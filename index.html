                <p>Ivano-Frankivsk (Ukrainian: Іва́но-Франкі́вськ [iˈwɑno frɐnˈkiu̯sʲk] (About this soundlisten); 
                   formerly Stanyslaviv, Stanislau, or Stanisławów; see below) is a historic city located in Western Ukraine. 
                   It is the administrative centre of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast.</p>
                <p>Built in the mid-17th century as a fortress of the Polish Potocki family, Stanisławów was annexed 
                    to the Habsburg Empire during the First Partition of Poland in 1772, after which it became 
                    the property of the State within the Austrian Empire. The fortress was slowly transformed into 
                    one of the most prominent cities at the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. After World War I, 
                    for several months, it served as a temporary capital of the West Ukrainian People's Republic.</p>
                <p>Following Peace of Riga, Stanisławów became part of the Second Polish Republic. After the Soviet 
                    invasion of Poland at the onset of World War II, the city was annexed by the Soviet Union, only 
                    to be occupied by Nazi Germany two years later. With the liberation of Soviet Ukraine in 1944 and 
                    the shifting of borders, the Communist regime ran the city for the next four-and-a-half decades. 
                    A few years before the fall of the Soviet Union, the blue-yellow flag was raised in the city 
                    as the symbol of an independent Ukraine.

                <p>Stanisławów was founded as a fortress and was named after the Polish hetman Stanisław "Rewera" Potocki. 
                    Some sources claim it was named after his grandson Stanisław.[7] Following the First Partition of Poland 
                    in 1772, the name was transliterated as Stanislau in German, as the city became part of the Austrian Empire 
                    (future Austria-Hungary); however, after the revolution of 1848, the city carried three different linguistic 
                    renderings of its name: German, Polish, and Ruthenian (German: Stanislau, pronounced [ˈʃtaːnɪslaʊ]; 
                    Polish: Stanisławów, pronounced [staɲiˈswavuf]; Ukrainian: Станісла́вів Stanislaviv,

                <p>As is the case with most of Ukraine, the climate is moderate continental with warm summers, and fairly
                     cold winters. The following climate data provided is for the past 62 years. The average number of days
                      with precipitation is 170 spread almost equally throughout a year.</p>

                <p>Most precipitation takes place 
                    during the winter months and least – early fall. Thunderstorms occur mostly in summer months averaging
                   around 25 annually.[19] Ivano-Frankivsk averages about 296 days of fog or misty days with about 24 per month.</p>

                <p>The city is situated in the Carpathian region northeast of the mountain range, sitting approximately 120 metres 
                    (390 ft) above mean sea level.[22] One of the several main geographical features is the Vovchynets Hill also 
                    known as the Vovchynets Mountains. The hill reaches 300-350 metres (1,150 ft) above the sea level and is part
                     of the Pokuttya Highland (Upland).</p>

                    Bystrytsia of Solotvyn, and Vorona. The last two rivers serve as a natural border between the Pokuttya Highland 
                    and Stanislav Basin. The Vovchynets Hill is located just outside and northeast of Ivano-Frankivsk. 
                    <span class="citation">"The highest point of that highland is Mount Hostra, 425 metres (1,394 ft)."</span>
                     Located southeast from the Stanislav Basin in the direction of the Prut Valley is the Khorosnen (Prut-Bystrytsia)
                     Highland.</p>

                <p>The city of Ivano-Frankivsk has an extensive network of public transport including buses, trolleybuses, 
                    and taxis. There are nine trolleybus routes and about 52 for regular buses. Some of the routes run 
                    beyond the city into nearby villages.</p>

                <p>Until 2008, the railway terminal also housed a bus terminal which provided several inter-city bus routes, 
                    including some to international destinations. In 2000, construction began on a new bus terminal next to 
                    the railway terminus on Zaliznychna Street. Inauguration of the new bus terminal took place on 22 May 2010. 
                    At the opening ceremony the Mayor of the city, Viktor Anushkevychus, noted that the new bus terminal was 
                    only partially completed, and for a period it would be necessary to offload passengers at the Pryvokzalna Square, 
                    which is already saturated with traffic. He also emphasised the need for another bus station on the outskirts 
                    of the city</p>
